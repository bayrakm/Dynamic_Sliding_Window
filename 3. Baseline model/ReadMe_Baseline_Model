Unveiling the Power of Predictive Algorithms: A Baseline Modelling Journey in our Dynamic Sliding Window Project

In our dynamic sliding window project, developing a robust baseline model forms the cornerstone of accurate price predictions. To achieve this, we embarked on a thorough baseline modelling process, examining various regression algorithms and their performance. Let's delve into each step of our journey and discover why the XGBoost Regressor emerged as the winning choice.

1. Understanding the Statistical Patterns:
We began by exploring the dataset's statistical patterns to comprehend the relationships between the features and the target column. This initial analysis provided valuable insights into the data's underlying structure, guiding us in selecting suitable regression models.

2. Creating a Representative Sample:
To effectively evaluate the models, we created a sample chunk of the dataset, ensuring it was stratified to perfectly represent the population. This sample chunk was carefully designed to avoid biased evaluations and provide a fair assessment of the models' capabilities.

After evaluating each model's performance, it became evident that the XGBoost Regressor stood out as the top performer. It achieved an impressive R2 score of 0.944, indicating its exceptional ability to explain the variance in the target variable. Moreover, the XGBoost Regressor exhibited the lowest MAE (1141.228) and RMSE (1666.459), demonstrating superior accuracy in predicting car prices.

The XGBoost algorithm's strength lies in its gradient boosting technique, which effectively handles complex relationships in the data and minimizes prediction errors. By ensembling multiple decision trees, XGBoost leverages the strengths of individual models, resulting in a powerful and precise predictive model.

In conclusion, our baseline modelling journey conclusively identifies the XGBoost Regressor as the optimal choice for our dynamic sliding window project. Its remarkable performance and ability to adapt to changing data patterns make it an invaluable asset in predicting automobile prices with unparalleled accuracy and reliability.
