# Building a Dynamic Price Prediction Model: Tackling Concept Drift in Automobile Markets

Inspired by the notion of data as a living organism, our research aims to develop an advanced price prediction model that remains relevant over time by adapting to the evolving nature of data. We recognize the limitations of static machine learning models in sustaining their effectiveness amidst changing circumstances. To address this, we embark on a comprehensive study leveraging real-time data acquired from reputable online platforms specializing in pre-owned car sales. Our dynamic modeling approach ensures the generation of accurate and up-to-date predictions by continuously incorporating fresh data points into our model. The foundation of our methodology lies in two critical phases. Firstly, we employ an automated web scraping pipeline to procure new data and update our dataset on a daily basis, enabling a continuous influx of information. Secondly, during the modeling phase, we employ the sliding window technique, a concept drift approach, to compare and evaluate the performance of the newly generated model against its predecessor. Through this comparison, we identify the superior model, ensuring our predictions are consistently refined and sensitive to market price fluctuations. The result is an agile, lightweight, and enduring dynamic model that surpasses the limitations of traditional approaches, providing invaluable insights into the ever-changing landscape of automobile pricing.
